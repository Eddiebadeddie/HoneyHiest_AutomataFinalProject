DFA transitions and data

(STATE, input) => (NEW_STATE)
(STATE, input, bool) => (NEW_STATE)

Description can have a few options based on boolean
	i.e Description = TEXT_1 | TEXT2 reads as Description can be TEXT_1 or TEXT_2

If the Description text has an appended P or F, then the player must roll for that. P is for passing the roll, F is for failing.
If the Description is dependent on a boolean, the boolean value will be placed above the text.
	i.e if Flag = true
		TEXT_TRUE
			"..."
		if Flag = false
		TEXT_FALSE
			"..."

If the description text states that the player has gained a point in Criminal, their stat must be updated.
If the description text states that the player has a new item in their inventory, the item must be inserted.
